Ajax Contact Form
=======================

A Simple Ajax Contact Form developed in PHP with HTML5 Form validation. Has a fallback in jQuery for browsers that do not support HTML5 form validation.

Open the archive [`process.php`](process.php) and set the sender's email in the following variable:
```php
$emailTo = '<YOUR_EMAIL_HERE>';
```
